name: Neil Lawrence
biography: Neil Lawrence is the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning
  at the University of Cambridge where he leads the University’s flagship
  mission on AI, AI@Cam. He has been working on machine learning models for over
  20 years. He recently returned to academia after three years as Director of
  Machine Learning at Amazon. His main interest is the interaction of machine
  learning with the physical world. This interest was triggered by deploying
  machine learning in the African context, where ‘end-to-end’ solutions are
  normally required. This has inspired new research directions at the interface
  of machine learning and systems research, this work is funded by a Senior AI
  Fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute. Neil is also visiting Professor at
  the University of Sheffield and the co-host of Talking Machines. He is the
  author of the forthcoming book The Atomic Human (release date 30th May 2024).
