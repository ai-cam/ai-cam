Dr Mireia Crispin is an award-winning Assistant Professor in the Department of Oncology at the University of Cambridge with a PhD in Particle Physics. Dr Crispin’s group at the University’s Early Cancer Institute is spearheading a new approach to cancer research and treatment. She and her colleagues are bringing together diverse datasets to decode one of the most fatal and least studied forms of gynaecological cancer: high-grade serous ovarian cancer. 

Drawing on information ranging from radiological imaging to biopsy data, patient demographics, treatment history, and tumour DNA markers, Dr Crispin and her team are developing sophisticated AI tools that personalise cancer diagnosis and treatment. These tools allow them to gain a deeper understanding of each patient’s unique cancer and to predict how patients might respond to treatment. “Once these techniques are more mature and have been validated,” Dr Crispin says, “the vision is that women who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer will be able to find the best possible treatment for them and for their specific cancer.” What used to take hours of painstaking research for radiologists reviewing radiology images and CT scans can now be done at pace with AI – allowing huge amounts of data to be processed and analysed within a matter of minutes. The highly-curated cohort of patients Dr Crispin is working with today numbers more than 1,000 women who have been treated for ovarian cancer. And she is also analysing data from a clinical trial involving 600 patients – numbers that were unthinkable even a few years ago.

## Data roadblocks

However, new challenges are emerging when it comes to accessing the data Dr Crispin needs for her cutting-edge research. The infrastructure for accessing the data doesn’t seem to be keeping pace with the speed of scientific progress. Although clinical health records are digitised for patients in Cambridge, which makes them relatively easy to access in theory, that isn’t always the case for historical pathology records. For retrospective studies, for example, some of the older biopsy and medical images Dr Crispin and her team needs have to be retrieved from data storage in Wales and scanned in manually, making data curation a long and arduous process. 

The original patient data, which is owned by the NHS, is highly confidential. Data from studies approved for analysis are extracted and stored anonymously on University servers in a secure data environment. Only researchers with valid NHS letters of access and research passports can access the data. Dr Crispin’s team works with a dedicated data manager who liaises with the NHS to make sure that the data is retrieved in a structured way that follows NHS frameworks and protocols assiduously. The data manager, who then also cleans and curates the anonymised data so that it’s suitable for specific research purposes, is paid for by Cancer Research UK (CRUK), which funds Cambridge Cancer Centre infrastructure costs. Any CRUKfunded research also needs to follow FAIR principles – which stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable - and is designed to ensure fairness, inclusivity and transparency in research. 

Embedding these principles in the Centre’s data management enables Dr Crispin’s team to publish enough data for each research project through scientific research papers so that the scientific community can reproduce and verify the results. Although each project varies in terms of publishing protocols, replicability is Dr Crispin’s minimum threshold when it comes to sharing data, which includes fully anonymised patient biomarkers and images. These datasets can be stored in public databases, the University’s own data sharing system (Apollo), or together with the code as part of the software repository. 

However, there are several other challenges when it comes to accessing data that hamper Dr Crispin’s work: “The barriers are generally that the data is not set up to be mined on a large scale,” says Dr Crispin. “Both from the point of view of how the data was taken in the first place and also from the point of view of the infrastructure, people and facilities that would enable you to rapidly access those data.
