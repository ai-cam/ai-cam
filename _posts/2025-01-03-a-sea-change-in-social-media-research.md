A key question for the Digital Mental Health Group – led by Dr Amy Orben at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge – is how growing up in a time of rapid digitalisation affects young people’s mental health and psychological well-being.

Until now, most studies in this field have used self-reported measures of time spent on social media platforms rather than focusing on how the platforms are actually being used. This approach has been an inexact science – in part due to the limitations of people’s own recollections, and also due to the lack of detailed insights into what people are interacting with on social media. 

To fill this gap, Dr Orben and her team have been exploring new ways of gathering data to help shed light on pressing policy questions about young people and their mental well-being – drawing on innovative and rigorous statistical methodology, secondary datasets, and Open Science approaches. The team has been piloting an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study using data donations from social media archives known as Data Download Packages (DDPs) to better understand user interactions with social media content. This new approach has become possible since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced across Europe and the UK in 2018, legally mandating all platforms that store their users’ data – including social media platforms – to share these data with their users upon request. If successful, the hope is that this
approach could form the basis of large-scale cohort studies.

Dr Orben and her team recruited around 500 young people aged 13 to 18 from across schools around the East of England to take part in a short study that involved downloading and sharing their
personal data (or DDPs) in a highly anonymised form from two of the most popular social media platforms among young people – TikTok and Instagram. The goal was to track in real time any connections between the content young people were interacting with on social media and their mood and well-being.


Dr Amanda Ferguson from the Digital Mental Health Group explained how the young people were recruited during lunchtime seminars at their schools. They received payments of up to £65 for taking part. The team had so many volunteers that they had to request more funding from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit to cover the additional data processing costs and participant payments. Eventually, 330 young people of the original 500 recruits submitted their data. Taking part in the study involved responding to three 5-minute
questionnaires a day – before school, after school and in the evening – for two weeks regarding their social media use and how it affected their mood and emotions, whether they were feeling happy, sad or lonely in the moment, for example. The young people would then download their data onto a web portal run by the Dutch company Eyra as a series of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files without the data ever leaving their hard
drives. Understandably, data processing protocols were incredibly tight. All of the data was anonymous and could not be linked in any way to an individual’s actual social media usage. This was crucial for protecting the young people’s privacy and adhering to the strict ethical framework for the study, which applies to
all of the group’s research, according to Dr Ferguson.
