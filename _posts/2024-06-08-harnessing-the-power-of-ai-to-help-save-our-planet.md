## What was the motivation behind the AI for climate and nature project?

The twin climate and biodiversity crises are two of the world’s most complex challenges to tackle. Accelerating global biodiversity loss – along with the deterioration of critical ecosystems and the release of greenhouse gases – demand a radical reconsideration of existing responses and policy. We urgently need to improve the way we measure the impact of human activities on biodiversity and ecosystems globally, while also tracking shifts in the distribution of habitats and organisms as a result of climate change.

The impact of human activity on the planet is shocking: we’re losing tropical rainforest at such a rate it could be gone in our lifetimes, destroying two-thirds of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity. With so much loss of habitat, there’s going to be nothing left to conserve…

## How does this project aim to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises? 

Over the last two decades, the University of Cambridge-based project Conservation Evidence has screened more than 1.6 million scientific papers on conservation, as well as manually summarising  8,600+ studies relating to conservation actions. However, the current project’s work is limited by the specialised skills needed to screen and summarise relevant studies. It took more than 75 person years to manually curate the current database and only a few 100 papers can be added each year. By accelerating these efforts, AI has the potential to transform the impact this database has on biodiversity conservation.

What we’re aiming to do through the ai@cam project – bringing together an interdisciplinary team from across the fields of computer science, ecology, climate and conservation – is to build up models of the world that are really detailed and that can be queried by policy makers to help make informed decisions. 

We’re planning to pull all of this together into one website as a one-stop shop within the Cambridge Centre for Earth Observation as part of the Cambridge Conservation Initiative – two of the ai@cam project partners.
