  content: New research strategies are needed to bridge the implementation gap
    between our aspirations for AI and our ability to deploy it to tackle major
    societal challenges. AI-deas is ai@cam's incubator for challenge-led AI
    research that tackles major scientific and societal challenges. Projects
    supported through AI-deas will generate new thinking about the role of AI in
    addressing major challenges, build coalitions in areas of need, and create
    partnerships to take research from lab to real-world benefit.
  heading: "An ambitious programme of AI innovation supported by ai@cam will spin
    up new research teams, develop collaborations with business, policymakers
    and civil society, and take innovative ideas from the lab to application. "
