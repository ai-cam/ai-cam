[Trust Conference](https://event.trustconference.com/event/5518f02b-ab8f-4ba5-8f59-61ac41690328/summary), hosted by [Thomson Reuters Foundation](https://www.trust.org/), is a two-day global forum that convenes experts, innovators, and activists at the forefront of shaping free and equitable societies, trustworthy institutions and inclusive and sustainable economies.

As AI continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, the need for coordinated global governance has become increasingly urgent to ensure the responsible and ethical development, deployment, and regulation of AI systems.

On Day 2 of Trust Conference, the ‘When tech policy becomes foreign policy: the future global governance of AI’ panel will explore potential solutions and assess the geopolitical risks resulting from the lack of a global framework.
