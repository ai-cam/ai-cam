Monday, 8 July 2024, 9.00am to Friday, 12 July 2024, 5.00pm

**Organiser:** Dr Marco A. Aquino-López, University of Cambridge with Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery and C2D3

**Location:** Robinson College, Crausaz Wordsworth Building 

#### **Welcome to the PaleoStats Workshop: AI and Statistical Innovations for Palaeoecological Research** 

We are excited to announce the upcoming PaleoStats Workshop at Robinson's College, Cambridge, from 7th to 12th July 2024. This workshop builds upon the foundations laid by the PaleoStats Conference I and earlier PaleoChronology Building Workshops, offering a unique blend of traditional and cutting-edge approaches in palaeoecological research.

#### **Limited Availability for Enhanced Interaction and Innovation - registrations opening soon**

This year's workshop is designed to foster active interaction and hands-on participation. To ensure a high level of engagement and effective collaboration, we are limiting the number of available places (no more than 30 participants). Our goal is to create an environment that not only facilitates the exchange of ideas but actively contributes to the creation and refinement of innovative models in palaeoecological research. We are seeking participants who are eager to be part of a dynamic team, working together to push the boundaries of our understanding and capabilities.

#### **Courses on Bayesian Statistics, AI, and Age-Depth Models**

Recognizing the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge in our field, we will be offering specialized courses as part of the workshop. These courses include:

* Bayesian Statistics in Paleo Science: A deep dive into the principles and applications of Bayesian methods in paleoenvironmental research.
* Artificial Intelligence: Exploring how AI can be leveraged to analyze and interpret complex data sets.
* Age-Depth Models: Techniques and tools for constructing accurate and reliable age depth models.
* Integration of Dating Information: Combining different dating methods to enhance the accuracy and precision of chronological models.

Our sessions will include a mix of invited talks, and practical computer-based workshops,utilizing the latest software and packages. These sessions will cover a wide range of topics, from advanced dating techniques to the integration of various data types for model building.

#### **Join Us for a Transformative Experience**

Set within the intellectually rich environment of Robinson's College, the PaleoStats Workshop promises to be a transformative experience. It's not just an opportunity to learn but to actively contribute to the advancement of our field. The workshop will provide a platform for you to engage with fellow experts, share your knowledge, and collaborate on innovative projects.

We encourage interested participants to apply early, as spaces are limited and will be filled based on a commitment to active engagement and contribution to our collective goals. This workshop is more than a series of lectures; it's a collaborative effort to develop new models and refine existing ones, pushing the boundaries of palaeoecological research.

#### **Secure Your Place in a Hub of Discovery and Innovation**

We cordially invite final-year PhD candidates, early career researchers, and esteemed professors to participate in the PaleoStats Workshop at Robinson's College, Cambridge.\
This event is not only for paleo and climate scientists but crucially involves statisticians, applied mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists. Your expertise in statistics, Machine Learning, and AI is of key importance as we delve into palaeosciences, seeking new ideas and advanced skills for innovative modeling.

This workshop is a unique opportunity to contribute your insights and methodologies to unravel the climate, environment, and evolution of our planet's past. Your involvement is vital in forging new paths and solutions in paleoscience research.
