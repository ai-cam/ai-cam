desc: Film and television production leads to a significant environmental
  footprint due to carbon-intensive infrastructures, energy dependencies, and
  waste production. While the past two decades have seen a rise in stakeholder
  discourse around sustainability and in critical attention to the industry’s
  environmental impacts, there is still a way to go to reach the level of impact
  sought. To help identify a path forward, this event will examine the
  industry’s current sustainability strategies, and explore how ambitious
  environmental and social policy can be developed.

Film and television production leads to a significant environmental footprint due to carbon-intensive infrastructures, energy dependencies, and waste production. While the past two decades have seen a rise in stakeholder discourse around sustainability and in critical attention to the industry’s environmental impacts, there is still a way to go to reach the level of impact sought. 

To help identify a path forward, this event will examine the industry’s current sustainability strategies, and explore how ambitious environmental and social policy can be developed.

This event follows the release of a new report, exploring both digitalisation and sustainability – and where these two intersect – across the UK film and television industry.

We will be joined by the report’s authors: Hunter Vaughan, Senior Research Associate at the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, and Pietari Kääpä, professor of Media Communications at the University of Warwick and other experts. 

This report comes out of extensive ongoing collaboration with industry stakeholders and policy makers. It lays out pathways to explore environmental and social sustainability, and to promote best practice in the digital age.

Join our expert discussion, with:
