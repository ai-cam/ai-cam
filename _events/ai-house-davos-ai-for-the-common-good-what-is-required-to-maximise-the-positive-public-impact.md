**Organiser:** AI House Davos

How might AI clusters worldwide cooperate to make the world a better place? How could we reinvent social entrepreneurship in the AI era?

A new initiative of an “AI for Public Impact Scaling Desk” will be launched at the round table to propose actionable steps toward these goals.
