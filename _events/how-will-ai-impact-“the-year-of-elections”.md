As nations globally approach a critical juncture with 68 countries partaking in elections, the rise of AI-generated synthetic media presents both challenges and opportunities for the electoral process. In this event experts from multidisciplinary backgrounds will explore the multifaceted impact of artificial intelligence on political elections. 

They will address the fine balance between the need for regulation and the drive for innovation in AI, alongside the media’s crucial role in ensuring accurate and fair political discourse in the face of deepfakes and disinformation. 

Join us for an insightful dialogue on shaping the integrity and future of democratic engagements through AI.

* What are the implications of AI-generated disinformation on democratic processes, and how can they be mitigated?
* In an era of deepfakes, what strategies can be employed to maintain public trust in the media and political discourse?
