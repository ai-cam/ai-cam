### Abstract

The pursuit of labour-saving technologies through artificial intelligence presents a paradox: while AI promises to reduce human workload, its development and maintenance heavily rely on human input, often in the form of low-wage, precarious data work. This contradiction raises important questions about the true cost and impact of automation technologies.

Recent years have seen a growing body of research examining the hidden human labour behind AI solutions. DiPLab’s extensive research in more than 20 countries across Africa, Europe, and Latin America has revealed a complex global landscape of AI data work. Our findings uncover an invisible workforce performing unstable gigs that fuel AI advancements, from annotating data for apps and moderating content for social media to training e-commerce algorithms and evaluating AI chatbot responses.

This perspective offers a nuanced understanding of AI’s global impact on labour. This presentation explores ethical concerns and power dynamics, addressing issues of worker exploitation, lingering colonial influences, and the long-term effects on job markets and wealth distribution in AI production. By shedding light on these often-overlooked aspects, our research aims to provide seminar participants with elements to challenge narratives of jobless futures and develop a more comprehensive view of the human contribution to digital technologies.
