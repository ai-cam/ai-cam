**What progress has been made, and what more is needed to bring more women into science and other professions where they are under-represented? Explore the impacts of societal expectations and stereotyping with prominent experts from three such fields, physics, technology and economics.**

Hear three leading experts, Prof Athene Donald, physicist, Tabitha Goldstaub, tech entrepreneur, and Prof Diane Coyle, economist, discuss their experiences of working in male-dominated subjects, how \[if] things have progressed, whether the digital revolution could have huge ramifications for the gender gap, and the significance to society and the economy.  

This special event marks the publication of Athene Donald’s book: *[Not just for the boys: why we need more women in science](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/not-just-for-the-boys-9780192893406?cc=gb&lang=en&)*, and is hosted in the Wren Library, Trinity College.  A drinks reception and book signing will follow the discussion.
