**T﻿itle:** Understanding Ourselves in the Age of AI – Neil Lawrence in conversation with Gina Neff\
\
**Organiser**: Cambridge Literary Festival\
\
**Location:** Old Divinity School, Cambridge

**Summary:** What does AI mean for our identity? Neil Lawrence attempts to answer this vast question at the Cambridge Literary Festival

The [Cambridge Literary Festival](https://www.cambridgeliteraryfestival.com/)‘s Winter Festival will take place on 23 & 24 November. The festival is a space to debate current issues, engage with literary greats alongside debut writers, host scientists, artists, politicians, comedians, historians, journalists, and poets, and celebrate the love of books.

On the second day of the festival, [Professor Gina Neff](https://www.mctd.ac.uk/team-members/gina-neff/) will host a conversation with [Professor Neil Lawrence](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ndl21)**,** DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and world expert on AI. Their discussion will delve into Professor Lawrence’s book *[The Atomic Human](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/455130/the-atomic-human-by-lawrence-neil-d/9780241625248),* exploring how and why our fears of being displaced by AI might be misplaced. Contrasting our evolved, embodied intelligence with the technical origins and limitations of AI systems, Professor Lawrence will explain how AI can and should be wielded, not just by experts but by ordinary people.
