  and managerial practice. The aim is to create a network that gets UK-based
  researchers and practitioners to talk to each other, by meeting once a year to
  do two things: 1) Present recent research and work in progress about the
  economics of digitization and 2) Receive feedback and input from practitioners
  where they would need more useful answers from the research community."

#### **Confirmed participants**

#### **Background and objective**

DigEcon connects research about the Economics of Digitization to policy and managerial practice. The aim is to create a network that gets UK-based researchers and practitioners to talk to each other, by meeting once a year to do two things: 1) Present recent research and work in progress about the economics of digitization and 2) Receive feedback and input from practitioners where they would need more useful answers from the research community.

A group with similar goals in the United States meets twice a year, at the National Bureau of Economic Research. In the UK, there are many researchers interested in Digitization, but a network has been sorely missing. We conceived this group in Spring 2022 and plan to make this an annual event. Currently, speakers from several universities (Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial, East Anglia) and the Competition and Markets Authority, have confirmed their attendance, with forthcoming acceptances from the Government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, and Ofcom. 

#### **Format** 

This year’s workshop is hosted by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge; and is sponsored by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, the Centre for Competition Policy, and the University of East Anglia. It will be held in person to provide a unique opportunity for the cross-fertilization of ideas between scholars and practitioners in competition policy. It will see the presentation of papers by both academics and economists working in government, as discussants.

#### **Topics of interest**

Internet and telecommunications | Digital markets and platforms | Artificial intelligence | Cloud computing | Big data | Value of data | Social media | ICT and innovation | ICT, productivity and growth | ICT and the labour market | Digital divide | Intellectual property rights | Standards | Competition policy and regulation of ICT | Economics of privacy.

#### **Travel, accommodation, and funding**

Participants are asked to cover their own travel and accommodation. A limited amount of funding is available for PhD students and speakers (upon request) to cover reasonable travel and hotel costs within a certain radius of Cambridge.
