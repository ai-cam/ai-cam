biography: I am a social scientist (PhD LSE, 2018) working at the intersection of
  expert decision-making, risk and technology policy. I am interested in understanding
  the long-term impacts of frontier AI systems on social and democratic processes
  and developing interventions that can shape these impacts and mitigate extreme risks.
  I am also Principal Investigator of the “Measuring the quality of collective reasoning”
  project, funded by the British Academy and a member of the next generation Event
  Horizon Telescope collaboration, where I lead the taskforces on expert forecasting
  and dissent.
