biography: 'Napoleon Katsos is interested in how experimental research in language
  acquisition and processing can inform theoretical linguistic inquiry and vice versa.
  His particular focus is in the area of semantics and pragmatics, especially implicature,
  presupposition and quantification. Together with colleagues, he has been awarded
  grants by the AHRC, the British Academy, the ESRC, and other funding bodies to work
  on aspects of experimental pragmatics with typically- and atypically-developing
  children and adults.


  Napoleon is also interested in bilingualism, and is a founder member of the Cambridge
  Bilingualism Network.


  For Napoleon''s publications, research interests and activities, visit his personal
  webpage.


  Dr Katsos welcomes inquiries from potential MPhil and PhD students with research
  interests relevant to his interests.'
