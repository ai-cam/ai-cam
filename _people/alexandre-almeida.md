biography: Alex is a Principal Investigator at the University of Cambridge,
  leading a research group aiming to understand the role that the hidden,
  uncultured microbiome plays in human health and disease. Throughout his
  research career he has specialized in the development and application of
  bioinformatics and genomic approaches to make biological discoveries with
  relevance to human health. After completing his PhD at the Institut Pasteur in
  Paris, he relocated to Cambridge as a Postdoctoral Fellow to expand his
  research to metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Using large-scale
  computational methods, his work led to the discovery of thousands of
  uncultivated bacterial species in the human gut microbiome, more than tripling
  the number of gut-associated species previously known. Now, as a PI his
  research focus is on characterizing the relevance of this huge novel microbial
  diversity for disease prediction, diagnostic and treatment.
