biography: My research in cognitive computational neuroscience sits at the
  interface of computational science and neuroscience. My experimental work aims
  to understand the role of lifelong learning and brain plasticity in enabling
  individuals of all ages to flexibly adapt to new settings and challenges. My
  computational work aims to develop predictive AI-guided models of brain and
  mental health with translational impact in early diagnosis of neurocognitive
  disorders and personalised interventions. I am a Royal Society Industry
  Fellow, Co-director of Cambridgeâ€™s Centre for Data Driven Discovery, Fellow
  and Cambridge University Lead at the Alan Turing Institute.
