  of the Language Technology Laboratory (LTL) and director of the Centre for
  Human Inspired Artificial Intelligence (CHIA). She obtained her PhD in
  Computer Science from the University of Cambridge and subsequently worked as a

  her projects are interdisciplinary in nature and involve collaboration with
  researchers in other fields and other areas of Artificial Intelligence.
