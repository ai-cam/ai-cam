biography: Andrew Grace is Professor of Experimental Cardiology at the
  University of Cambridge. He trained in cardiology in London and Cambridge and
  then delivered a consistently high-volume interventional practice focused on
  arrhythmias over >30 years. He completed post-doctoral studies as a Fulbright
  Scholar in the Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego
  returning to Cambridge as British Heart Foundation Senior Research Fellow.  He
  is a recognized innovator having a particular interest in ‘disruptive’
  technologies that have included devices, diagnostics and drugs. Some of his
  work has changed practice significantly and he made some of the ‘most
  important contributions’ to the development and implementation of subcutaneous
  defibrillators. His clinical research focus is currently on both activation
  mapping and risk prediction of ventricular fibrillation. He has spent over 25
  years addressing the impact of genetic variation on the heartbeat and most
  recently has established a network of colleagues based respectively in
  Cambridge, Seattle, Sydney and San Diego to provide a physically robust model
  of cardiac electrical measurement extending from charge movements through
  structurally resolved sodium channels to surface recordings. Working with the
  Theory of Condensed Matter Physics Group (Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge) and
  the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute high-resolution charge density mapping of
  cardiac activation is being linked to multi-omics in single cells acquired
  through novel in vivo freeze-sampling; there is high anticipation of
  therapeutic target identification and rescue.
