biography: "Diana's interest in biology started as a physics undergrad studying topological\
  \ properties of the transcriptional network in budding yeast. After that, she was\
  \ hooked and moved to soft matter and protein self-assembly for her PhD, under the\
  \ supervision of Dr. Charbonneau at Duke. Unsatisfied with addressing questions\
  \ exclusively on the computational side, she embarked onto a hybrid postdoc in Dr.\
  \ Hallatschek lab at UC Berkeley, where she studied the evolutionary consequences\
  \ of spatial range expansion combining microbiology and mathematical modeling.\n\
