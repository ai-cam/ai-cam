biography: 'Wild pollinator conservation


  Wild pollinators are important to crop production and wild plant reproduction, and
  most of this pollination service is carried out by a relatively small number of
  common, widespread bee species. To preserve this ecological function, and optimise
  it for agriculture, we need landscapes that support common wild pollinators in the
  long term, by providing the food and nesting resources they need at the appropriate
  scale.


  We use a combination of laboratory experiments, field ecology, genetics and remote
  sensing to understand how wild bees use landscapes and respond to land management.
  We have current projects with the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Earlham Institute,
  Berry World, Hutchinson''s Ltd, Greencell Ltd and the Centre for Pollination Studies
  in Calcutta, India. We also work on pollinator conservation from policy and agronomic
  perspectives. What actions are cost-effective and feasible, to support and conserve
  common and declining wild pollinators? How do these actions fit within a program
  of ecological intensification, to enhance or maintain intensive production within
  a thriving agricultural ecosystem? How can growers using managed pollinators minimise
  impacts on wild pollinator populations?


  Farm management for biodiversity


  I work on how farmers can benefit from ecosystem services and reduce impacts on
  wildlife in realistic commercial contexts. I lead a Newton-funded project on sustainable
  fruit faming in northeast Brazil, measuring biodiversity and ecosystem service responses
  to farm management (www.sufica.org). Members of my team have projects focused on
  managing landscapes for wild pollinators in UK arable and soft fruit farms.


  Evidence-based conservation


  I have developed methods to compile and synthesize ecological evidence and make
  it useful for decision-making. I am a member of the Conservation Evidence core team
  and chair the Methods Expert Group for the Eklipse science-policy mechanism on biodiversity
  and ecosystem services. I use rigorous approaches to gather expert judgement, for
  rapid, transparent assessment of evidence, and build user-friendly models to support
  farm management decisions (see for example, the Cool Farm Biodiversity Tool). I
  work with organisations that manage the environment, in Government, the charitable
  sector and the food and farming industry.'
