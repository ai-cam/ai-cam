biography: 'I study the design, architecture and algorithms of scalable and

  robust end-to-end machine learning (ML) systems. My research

  interests drive towards the development of new forms of ML systems

  that are revolutionary in how they leverage multi-modal data (e.g.,

  speech, vision, location, inertial information) to infer and reason

  over complex real-world situations â€” while simultaneously,

  maintaining extreme levels of systems flexibility (e.g., distributed

  execution, adaptation) and efficiency (e.g., compute, memory).
