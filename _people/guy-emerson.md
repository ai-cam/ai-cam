biography: >-
  I began my undergraduate studies as a mathematician at Trinity College,
  Cambridge, before switching to a masters in computer science, focusing on
  computational linguistics.  I then spent one year studying at Saarland
  University and working at DFKI (the German Research Centre for Artificial
  Intelligence), before returning to Cambridge to pursue a PhD under the
  supervision of Ann Copestake, which I completed in 2018.  I am currently an
  Executive Director of Cambridge Language Sciences, a Departmental Early-Career
  Academic Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, and a
  College Lecturer and Bye-Fellow at Gonville & Caius College.


  I was born in Singapore and grew up in London.  I speak English (native), German (fluent), French (fluent), Hokkien (intermediate), Mandarin (intermediate), and bits and pieces of others, including Greek, Georgian, Swedish, Dutch, and Rhine-Franconian.
