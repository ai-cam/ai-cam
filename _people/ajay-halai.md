biography: "I am a Principal Investigator (MRC Career Development Award 2021-2026)\
  \ and Senior Research Associate.\n\nMy research group is focused on understanding\
  \ diagnosis and prognosis in stroke aphasia using a multi-modal approach (behavioural,\
  \ neuroimaging, non-invasive brain stimulation, computational modelling and machine\
  \ learning).\n\nThe research is important and it spans basic scientific discover\
  \ through to clinical translation, which can impact: 1) our theoretical understanding\
  \ of how cognitive processes recovery after brain injury, 2) predictive value for\
  \ prognosis, both for the patients and clinical rehabilitation, and 3) the implementation\
  \ of novel individualised therapeutics. \n\nBiography\n\nI completed a BSc and MSc\
  \ at the University of York (psychology and cognitive neuroscience, respectively),\
  \ followed by a cross discipline PhD (MRC Capacity-Building) at the University of\
  \ Manchester, combining psychology with neuroimaging. I then moved toward applied\
  \ research under the mentorship of Prof Matthew Lambon Ralph at the University of\
  \ Manchester and MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. I started my own lab in\
  \ 2021 but I continue to collaborate with a multidisciplinary team, where I use\
  \ convergent methods to investigate recovery and/or decline following brain disorder."
