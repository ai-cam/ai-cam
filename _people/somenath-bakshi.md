biography: Somenath Bakshi is an Associate Professor in the Department of
  Engineering at the University of Cambridge. He did his PhD in University of
  Wisconsin Madison under Professor James Weisshaar â€“ developing
  super-resolution imaging technologies to study central cellular processes in
  microbes. After finishing his PhD, he moved to Harvard University for his
  postdoc with Professor Johan Paulsson in the Department of Systems Biology.
  During his postdoc Somenath developed high-throughput timelapse imaging
  technologies to study stress-response in bacteria. In 2019, he moved to
  Cambridge, and established the Laboratory of Systems and Synthetic
  Microbiology. His work focuses on the analysis of the genetic and metabolic
  factors underlying the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and engineering
  diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic
  resistance. He is also the head of the recently established Smart Microscopy
  Laboratory, which is a cross-school platform for bringing together engineers,
  computer scientists, and biologists to develop targeted imaging solutions for
  specific biological problems.
