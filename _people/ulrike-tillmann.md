biography: 'Ulrike Tillmann is a mathematician who has worked in topology, K-theory,
  and non-commutative geometry. Her well-known work on moduli spaces has been motivated
  by problems in quantum physics and string theory, while some of her recent work
  in applied topology addresses challenges in data science.


  Born in Germany, Tillmann attended her local grammar school. With the help of a
  Wien Scholarship she studied at Brandeis University and later received her PhD from
  Stanford University.  Following a post-doctoral position in Cambridge she spent
  most of her career in Oxford and Merton College. Currently she is the Rothschild
  & Sons Professor in Cambridge, Director of the Isaac Newton Institute,  President
  of the London Mathematical Society (LMS), and Vice-President of the International
  Mathematical Union (IMU).


  For her outstanding research Tillmann was awarded the Whitehead Prize by the LMS
  in 2004, the Besselâ€“Humboldt Forschungs Preis in 2008, elected an inaugural Fellow
  of the American Mathematical Society in 2012 and a Member of the Leopoldina in 2017.
  She has been a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute since its establishment in 2015,
  and currently she serves on scientific boards of several international  institutions,
  including  the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF).


  A former member of  Council of the Royal Society 2017-20 during which time she also
  served as interim Vice-President, she has chaired the Royal Society''s Education
  Committee since 2020.'
