biography: Albert Cardona studied Biology at the University of Barcelona
  (1996-2000), where he also completed a PhD in Developmental Biology
  (2000-2005). After a short stint as a software engineer at the Institute of
  Neuroinformatics in Zurich (2005) and a postdoc in neurobiology of Drosophila
  at UCLA (2005-2008), which led to the founding of the Fiji image processing
  software, Albert was awarded a junior group leader position at the Institute
  of Neuroinformatics in Zurich (2008-2011) where he developed software
  (TrakEM2; CATMAID) for serial section electron microscopy registration and
  analysis of neural circuits, to enable and support his research on Drosophila
  connectomics. He then was awarded a group leader position at the Howard Hughes
  Medical Institute at Janelia Research Campus (HHMI; 2012-2019) where he
  organized dozens of laboratories world wide to jointly map the synaptic wiring
  diagram of the larval Drosophila nervous system. In 2015, Albert was awarded a
  lectureship (2015-2016) and then was promoted to reader on connectomics
  (2017-to-date) at the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience
  (PDN) at the Unversity of Cambridge. In 2019, Albert moved to Cambridge, was
  awarded fellowship at Pembroke college, and was awarded a programme leader
  position at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC
  LMB) to conduct research on the structure-function relationship of neural
  circuits within the newly formed Molecular Connectomics Inititative at the MRC
  LMB.  Albert Cardona maps neuronal circuits with synaptic resolution using
  volume electron microscopy, and studies how the structure of a neural circuit
  relates to its function. The lab uses optophysiology, electrophysiology,
  electron microscopy, light microscopy, Drosophila transgenics, computer
  vision, machine learning and software engineering.
