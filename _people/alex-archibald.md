biography: 'Professor Alex Archibald is a Lecturer in Atmospheric Chemistry Modelling
  in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of Emmanuel
  College, Cambridge. His research involves the development and application of state-of-the-art
  chemistry-climate models. With these models his group is trying to answer a number
  of questions relevant to society: (i) What are the impacts of changes in man made
  emissions on the composition of the atmosphere (ii) how does the changing composition
  of the atmosphere affect climate (iii) how will a changing climate impact the composition
  of the atmosphere.


  Dr Archibald is also a co-ordinator of the Cambridge Centre for Climate Science,
  which promotes research and other activities in Climate Science going on at several
  Departments of the University of Cambridge (Applied Mathematics and Theoretical
  Physics, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Geography, Plant Sciences and Scott Polar Research
  Institute) and at the British Antarctic Survey.'
