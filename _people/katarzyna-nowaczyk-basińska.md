biography: 'Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basińska is a Research Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre
  for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, with a background
  in cultural and media studies. In her work, she explores how digital technologies
  (re)shape our understanding of death, loss, grief, and afterlife presence. From
  2020 to 2023, she held an individual grant entitled “Immortality: Contemporary Technocultural
  Strategies,” funded by the Polish National Science Center. She is also a team member
  of an international scientific consortium, ''Digital Death: Transforming History,
  Ritual, and Afterlife,'' as a part of the EU CHANSE initiative. In 2023, she was
  nominated for the AI2050 program for Early Career Fellows at Schmidt Futures for
  her research on the meaning of life and death in the age of AI.'
