biography: Dr Boemo is interested in genomic instability, which is characterised
  by the rapid accumulation of mutations commonly observed in cancer cells. His
  particular focus lies in understanding how genomic instability is instigated
  by defective DNA replication and repair mechanisms. Having completed a BA in
  Mathematics at Rutgers University and a PhD in Physics at the University of
  Oxford, he addresses this complex issue through the lenses of mathematics and
  computer science by developing machine learning and high-performance
  simulation techniques to unravel the underlying causes of DNA replication and
  repair defects. This approach allows for exploring novel avenues for targeting
  these defects with therapeutic interventions, both in human cancer cells and
  pathogens. Currently, Dr Boemo holds the position of Assistant Professor of AI
  and Machine Learning in Disease, with a joint appointment in the Department of
  Pathology and the Department of Genetics.
