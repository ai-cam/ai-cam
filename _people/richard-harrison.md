biography: 'Dr Harrison completed his PhD in systems biology at the University of
  Manchester, followed by a Medical Research Council Fellowship at the University
  of Edinburgh in bioinformatics and population genetics. He joined East Malling Research
  in 2011 as a research leader developing into his role as the head of the genetics,
  genomics and breeding department in 2016, following its takeover by NIAB. In his
  new role he leads one of four units in NIAB - Cambridge Crop Research.


  His own research focuses on understanding the genetic basis of complex traits, often
  using interactions between plants and microbes as a study system. He works at the
  interface between molecular biology, statistical genetics and machine learning.
  While at East Malling he developed research in horticultural crops such as strawberry,
  apple and cherry.
