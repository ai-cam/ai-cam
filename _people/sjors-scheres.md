biography: 'Sjors Scheres is a structural biologist who was born and educated in The
  Netherlands, where he obtained his PhD at Utrecht University in 2003. He has been
  a Programme Leader at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology
  since 2010.


  Sjors made fundamental contributions to three-dimensional structure determination
  of protein complexes by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). He formulated a Bayesian
  framework for high-resolution reconstruction of cryo-EM images and their classification
  into distinct structural states, and implemented these methods in the RELION software
  package. He used these methods to reach a milestone in cryo-EM structure determination
  of protein complexes: reconstruction to atomic-resolution.


  In collaboration with Michel Goedert, Sjors also applied his methods to solve atomic
  structures of amyloid filaments from the brains of individuals with neurodegenerative
  disease, including tau filaments from Alzheimer''s disease. Surprisingly, although
  different diseases are characterised by amyloid formation of the same protein, specific
  amyloid structures were observed for each disease.'
