  Fellowship: My fellowship project has three stands: 1. Finding ways to
  directly combine and assess different forms of evidence (e.g., the scientific
  literature and indigenous and local community knowledge) into evidence-based
  decision-making; 2. Developing new approaches to assessing the reliability and
  relevance of evidence to different decision-making contexts; 3. Quantifying
  the generalisability of evidence for different conservation actions to
  understand whether the findings of evidence transfer well between different
  contexts. I want to ensure that in the future, evidence-based decision-making
  combines diverse sources of knowledge for decision-making, whilst making sure
  to assess the reliability and relevance of each piece of evidence so we can
  provide tailored recommendations to decision-makers based on their local
  context. 


  Previous work: My PhD research focused on applying evidence-based principles from medicine to biodiversity conservation via the Conservation Evidence project. In particular, my work involved quantifying the gaps and biases in the evidence base for conservation, as well as co-developing decision support tools with conservationists to make the reasoning and evidence behind their decision-making more transparent. In my postdoc with the Conservation Evidence project, I worked on the BioRISC project to design and improve an interface to an online application that enables users to obtain customised syntheses of evidence on invasive species management interventions that are dynamically updated (www.metadataset.com).
