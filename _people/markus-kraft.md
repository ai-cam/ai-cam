biography: Prof Markus Kraft is a Fellow of Churchill College Cambridge and Professor
  in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology. He is the director
  of CARES ltd., the Singapore-Cambridge CREATE Research Centre. He is also a principal
  investigator of “Cambridge Centre for Carbon Reduction in Chemical Technology (C4T)”.  He
  obtained the academic degree 'Diplom Technomathematiker' at the University of Kaiserslautern
  in 1992 and completed his Doctor rerum naturalium in Technical Chemistry at the
  same University in 1997. Subsequently, he worked at the University of Karlsruhe
  and the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics in Berlin. In
  1999 he became a lecturer in the Department of Chemical Engineering, University
  of Cambridge. He has a strong interest in the area of computational modelling and
  optimisation targeted towards developing carbon abatement and emissions reduction
  technologies for the automotive, power and chemical industries. He has contributed
  significantly towards the detailed modelling of combustion synthesis of organic
  and inorganic nanoparticles and worked on engine simulation, spray drying and the
  granulation of fine powders. More recently, he has been working on cyber physical
  systems employing time varying knowledge graphs with the aim to build large cross
  domain applications that help to reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions.
  In 2021, he was elected Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute.
