biography: "Richard is a computational biologist. He is a Professor of Genetics at
  the University of Cambridge and currently an Associate Faculty member at the Wellcome
  Trust Sanger Institute. \n\nHe is involved in a wide variety of genomic genetics
  projects from a computational and mathematical perspective. Current interests include
  genetic variation, evolutionary and population genetics in humans and cichlid fishes,
  and algorithms and software for high-throughput sequencing and genome assembly.\n\nIn
  the past Richard has led a number of large scale genomics projects, including the
  1000 Genomes Project (with David Altshuler at the Broad Institute) and the UK10K
  project, both of which completed in 2015, and the gorilla reference sequencing project.
  Previously he worked on sequence analysis software including hidden Markov model
  (HMM) methods for gene finding and protein similarity detection, jointly authoring
  a book Biological Sequence analysis with Sean Eddy, Anders Krogh and Graeme Mitchison.
  He also helped establish a number of reference genomic databases including WormBase
  for C.elegans biology (using the ACeDB software he co-developed with Jean Thierry-Mieg),
  Pfam, TreeFam and Ensembl. In the further past, Richardâ€™s postdoc was with David
  Rumelhart on the foundations of back-propagation in multi-layer networks."
