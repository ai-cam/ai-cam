A new funding call has been announced under the ai@cam AI-deas scheme targeting research in AI for education and cultural heritage.

The new funding call will build research collaborations and partnerships that can contribute to AI in these sectors, supported by ai@cam’s AI-deas incubator in collaboration with Accelerate Science.

Introducing the call, Jess Montgomery, Director of ai@cam and Accelerate Science said: “AI is shaping how we preserve, access, and share our cultural and scientific knowledge. From decoding ancient texts to shaping how students learn in the classroom, advances in AI offer opportunities across the education and cultural heritage sectors. This funding call is an opportunity to develop AI that connects AI development to our rights to education, cultural life, and access to science.”

Prof Neil Lawrence, Chair of ai@cam, said: “This new funding call will set the foundations for research collaborations and partnerships across disciplines that can contribute to AI in these key areas. Bringing this vision to life will require research, policy, and practice that ensures AI works for science, citizens, and society.”

Activities supported by the call could include engagement with underrepresented communities to understand how AI could serve their needs; co-design or prototyping of AI tools with practitioners in the education and cultural heritage sectors; or research to create AI systems that can meet the needs of those working in these sectors. This list is by no means exhaustive. We encourage applicants to submit innovative ideas that fit the call remit. All ideas must have their roots in interdisciplinary research that addresses real world needs.

Researchers from across the University of Cambridge are invited to submit their expressions of interest by 17:00, 7 October 2024 Feedback received through these expressions of interest will support in shaping the function and form of the funding call, which will offer a total of £150,000 to supported projects. After submitting their expressions of interest, researchers will later be invited to a workshop in the autumn term to share ideas and build collaborations. 

If you would like to express interest in this call, please fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuuHi0SR6Mfwmzf2BGexUKwfF9txcL10qUmR2DLdlw-P0g7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) by 17:00, 7 October 2024.
