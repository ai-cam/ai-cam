With biodiversity facing unprecedented challenges, researchers have identified a number of key areas AI technology could be used to transform existing conservation practices and reverse biodiversity loss. 

A new study, led by conservation biologist [Dr. Sam Reynolds](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-sam-reynolds) and funded by ai@cam, has brought together an international panel of conservation scientists and AI experts to explore how artificial intelligence can drive innovation in conservation. 

Through a comprehensive [horizon scan](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/conservation-research-policy-and-practice/scanning-horizons-in-research-policy-and-practice/91C9F5CD3B06665534F4725C3BC287B9), the research highlights AI's vast potential to tackle critical environmental challenges and identified new opportunities where AI could make significant contributions in conservation. These span from refining tools for addressing human-wildlife conflict, enhancing predictive models of biodiversity loss, and enabling AI-driven advisory systems to inform policy.
The horizon scan outlined several transformative applications of AI in conservation. 

Among the 21 opportunities identified are:

1. **Monitoring Marine Life with Distributed Acoustic Sensing**\
   Novel AI-enabled technologies for marine monitoring, such as [Distributed Acoustic Sensing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23606-x) (DAS), could transform how we observe underwater ecosystems. DAS repurposes over 1 million kilometers of deep-sea fiber-optic cables—typically used for telecommunications—to detect real-time underwater acoustic signals. By analysing how sound waves affect the light path in these cables, the technology can identify and locate sounds from marine species like whales, fish, and seals, as well as human activities such as shipping and deep-sea mining. This technology could provide unique insights into marine biodiversity as well as human activities which may impact them. 
2. **Unveiling 'Dark Diversity'**\
   AI-powered models for “novel category discovery” are enabling researchers to detect previously unidentified species from wildlife images. This breakthrough could help document “dark diversity”- species thought to be absent from certain habitats, believed extinct, or entirely unknown to science. This will help conservationists to prioritise conservation efforts and act to preserve these rare species. 
3. **Cracking Down on Illegal Wildlife Trade**\
   AI-driven technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal machine learning are providing powerful tools to combat illegal wildlife trade. These systems can analyse images, text, video, and audio to identify what species and wildlife products are being traded through various networks and marketplaces. 

#### Balancing Risks

While advancing technologies will undoubtedly lead to changes in conservation over the coming years, the study outlines the risks in implementing novel AI systems. AI colonialism is a central concern, with data potentially being extracted from the Global South to data centres in the Global North. These could be used to train AI models which risk perpetuating inequitable practices and undermine efforts in contemporary conservation to address colonial legacies. 

Senior author, [Professor William Sutherland](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/bill-sutherland) stated: “AI seems likely to enable exciting opportunities whilst creating serious problems. Looking ahead to identify potential benefits and challenges is key to delivering more effective conservation whilst minimising risks”. 

Further concerns surround resource allocation; there is a risk that the perceived novelty of AI could skew funding and leadership away from traditional conservation efforts. Issues such as bias in AI models, the militarisation of conservation tools, and unequal access to computational resources need careful consideration. 

Reflecting on the findings, Dr. Reynolds remarked: “AI will likely be a powerful tool for advancing conservation science, but does not represent a universal solution to the problems we face. Traditional fieldwork, education, and ecological expertise remains central. It is vital we are working with local communities to ensure AI tools are not detached from the social and ecological reality on the ground.”

Study Co-Author [Dr Amy Hinsley](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/amy-hinsley), University of Oxford says “ One of the major challenges in managing the wildlife trade is a lack of up-to-date and good quality data, which can be lacking for both legal and illegal trade. Applying new and existing AI approaches has the potential to fill some of these evidence gaps, accessing new data sources and making better use of the data that we have on the species, supply chains, and volumes of wildlife in trade’”

This study was led by Cambridge researchers at the [Conservation Evidence](https://www.conservationevidence.com/) and the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) with funding from ai@cam, the University of Cambridge's mission to drive a new wave of AI innovation that delivers public value.
