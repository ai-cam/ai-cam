biography: I am a research associate in the Centre for the Study of Existential
  Risk at the University of Cambridge. I am the co-founder and principal
  investigator of the Ethics in Mathematics Project, where my work addresses the
  ethical challenges and risks posed by mathematics, mathematicians, and
  mathematically-powered technologies. My research looks at the ethical issues
  arising in all types of mathematical work, including AI, blockchain, finance,
  modelling, surveillance, cryptography, and statistics. I have been running a
  seminar series on ethics in mathematics for the past 7 years as part of the
  Cambridge University Ethics in Mathematics Society, and sat on the ethics
  advisory group of Machine Intelligence Garage UK for 3 years, working with
  over 25 AI startups in that time. I come from a background in research
  mathematics, holding two PhDs in mathematics from the University of Cambridge
  and the University of Melbourne on problems in algebra and computability
  theory. I have over 20 years experience studying, working, and teaching, in
  mathematics departments around the world.
