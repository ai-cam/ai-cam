  I am working on the application of a novel method of evidence synthesis termed
  ‘dynamic meta-analysis’ to better understand the impacts of invasive species
  on ecosystems and biodiversity, on a local and global scale.


  Meta-analysis is often used to make generalisations across all available evidence at the global scale. However, there is debate over how can these global generalisations can be used for evidence-based decision making at the local scale, especially if the global evidence is not perceived to be relevant to local decisions. I will be developing an interactive method of meta-analysis, which will alter how decision makers can use and assess the local relevance of global evidence. 


  The aim of my research is to harness this approach to evidence synthesis and turn it towards the appraisal of the impacts and management of invasive species.
