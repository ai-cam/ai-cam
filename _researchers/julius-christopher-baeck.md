biography: I am a final year PhD student in Klaus Okkenhaug's Group at the
  Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge. My work centres around the
  role of the lipid signalling enzyme PI3KÎ´ in B cell homeostasis and cancer. I
  generate large datasets to assess cellular phenotypes which triggered my
  curiosity on how to best utilise AI in biological research.
