biography: 'I am the Science Leader for the AI Lab at [British Antarctic

  Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/ai),

  and Co-Director for the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in

  Digital Twins

  ([TRIC-DT](https://www.turing.ac.uk/tricdigitaltwins)

  at [the Alan Turing

  Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

  Our aim is in the development of AI and digital twin technologies for

  monitoring, understanding, predicting and designing solutions for

  environmental change.


  Our projects include the [intelligent fusion of data from satellite

  and in-situ surface

  sensors](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environmental-monitoring-blending-satellite-and-surface-data)
  to

  help understand our changing planet; probabilistic machine learning

  for localised climate impacts; [AI for seasonal sea ice

  forecasting](https://scotthosking.com/icenet) and

  improving climate models; and [computer vision

  toolkits](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision) for

  tracking environmental change and wildlife monitoring.'
