biography: 'Sarah develops computational methods, to explore structural biology, genomics
  and single cell biology data. She showed that protein complexes assemble via stereotypical
  pathways, helping us understand mechanisms of genetic diseases including cancer.
  These insights aid design in protein engineering, and in deciphering protein interaction
  and cell communication networks. Applying analogous ideas, she uncovered principles
  of transcriptional network evolution in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. She pioneered
  application of single cell technologies, coupled with innovative computational methods,
  to study human tissues, discovering novel immune, epithelial, and stromal cell states
  across development, adult and disease tissue. Human studies include exploration
  of the maternal-fetal interface, complex lymphoid organs such as the thymus, and
  systems such as the airways. These approaches have delivered insights into human
  disease including cancer, respiratory, and auto-immune disease and have profound
  implications for therapeutic development including target discovery, tissue engineering
  and cell therapies.


  Sarah is co-founder and co-leader of the international Human Cell Atlas consortium,
  which uses single cell genomics and spatial methodologies to create a comprehensive
  high resolution map of the human body.'
