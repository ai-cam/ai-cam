biography: 'Dr. Reham Hosny is a British Academy Visiting Fellow at the Leverhulme
  Centre for the Future of Intelligence, where she researches the intersection of
  AI, text and power. Her current interdisciplinary project aims to produce both academic
  outputs and tools for writers and artists working in and against authoritarian regimes.
  Dr. Hosny’s research background lies at the intersection of the fields of Cultural
  Studies, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities. Her work appears in peer-reviewed
  journals such as the Journal of Postcolonial Writing and Digital Culture & Society,
  and her forthcoming book @ArabicELit: Electronic Literature in the Arab World (2023,
  Bloomsbury) highlights new aesthetics and perspectives of the emergent field of
  electronic literature. She is an invited speaker at several international conferences
  and symposiums, and a member of various international research networks such as
  the Intersections, Feminism, Technology & Digital Humanities network (IFTe) funded
  by UKRI-AHRC and the Irish Research Council, and the Global AI Narrative (GAIN)
  network in the MENA region.  Dr. Hosny is an Assistant Professor at Minia University
  and previously was a Lecturer at the University of Leeds. She completed her joint-supervision
  Ph.D. in digital literary studies and critical theory between the Rochester Institute
  of Technology-New York and Minia University.  She is an award-winning digital creative
  writer and her co-authored novel, Al-Barrah [The Announcer] (2019, 2021), the first
  Arabic artificial intelligence novel, won the 2022 Robert Coover Award’s Honorable
  Mention. Dr. Hosny is the first Arab and African to be elected as a director at
  the international Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) and to be a convener
  of the ELO awards (2023).'
