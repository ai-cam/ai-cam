biography: We study the neural basis for flexible cognitive control,
  underpinning the incredible human capacity for diverse and flexible behaviour.
  Our research uses multivariate analysis of fMRI, E/MEG, and combined TMS-fMRI
  data. We are interested in how information from the world is represented,
  exchanged, and transformed between brain regions and how (and whether!) the
  activation patterns we decode give rise to thought and behaviour. We focus on
  frontoparietal ?multiple-demand? (MD) brain regions which are involved in a
  wide range of tasks. These regions appear to prioritise coding of
  task-relevant information, providing a neural basis for selective attention.
  Projects examine the flexibility of the system, the relationship with visual
  cortices, and the links between MD coding and behaviour. Separately, we are
  developing methods to study language abilities in children with Autism who do
  not speak. We aim to use neuroimaging to examine cognition in this
  understudied population.
