biography: After a undergraduate education in Physics and Mathematics, I worked on
  optimisation problems using neural networks for my PhD at Lund University, Sweden.
  I then moved towards modelling in Biology as a postdoc at Caltech, CA. I've continued
  modelling plant development and morphogenesis and have been at the Sainsbury Laboratory
  since 2011.
