biography: 'Gábor Csányi is an expert in atomistic simulation, particularly in multi-scale
  modelling that couples quantum mechanics to larger length scales. He is currently
  engaged in applying machine learning and other data intensive techniques to physics,
  chemistry and material science and in particular to the problem of deriving force
  fields (interatomic potentials) from ab initio electronic structure data.


  Gábor is also interested in statistical problems in molecular dynamics, e.g. in
  enhanced sampling algorithms that can be used to explore the global configuration
  space of materials and molecules. He contributes to the running of the Lennard-Jones
  Center in Cambridge which brings together modellers who work on the atomic scale.'
