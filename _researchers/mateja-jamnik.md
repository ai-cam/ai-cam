biography: 'Mateja Jamnik is Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the Department
  of Computer Science and Technology (Computer Laboratory) at the University of Cambridge.
  She is also an associate fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence.
  Recently she served as Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Select Committee
  on Artificial Intelligence. She founded the women@CL initiative.


  She is interested in human intuitive reasoning and wants to make computers think
  intuitively too. She builds computational models that capture human informal reasoning
  - she is essentially trying to humanise computer thinking. She combines AI reasoning
  with machine learning techniques in order to advance the explainability of AI systems,
  and applies them to personalise medicine and tutoring systems.


  Broadly, her research is in the areas of artificial intelligence, human-like computation,
  machine learning, explainability, automated reasoning, diagrammatic reasoning, knowledge
  representation, theorem proving, cognitive science, human-computer interaction.'
