biography: 'Professor Bill Sutherland holds the Miriam Rothschild Chair of Conservation
  Biology in the Zoology Department and is a professorial Fellow in the College. He
  has written seven books and edited another five. He started as a birdwatcher and
  his main research interest has been in combining field observations of behaviour
  with theoretical models to predict the consequences of environmental change, such
  as changes in agricultural practice and climate change. His main current interests
  involve collaborating with policy makers to improve global conservation practice.
  This includes identifying environmental issues that have attracted insufficient
  attention using horizon scanning, collaborating with practitioners to identify the
  key knowledge gaps and establishing evidence-based conservation as a standard approach.
  He regularly provides advice to government and practitioners.


  He teaches ecology and conservation biology.  He also teaches on the Masters in
  Public Policy and Masters in Conservation Leadership courses.'
