biography: I am a Director of Research, equivalent to Professor, in the Department
  of Chemistry, and a researcher in the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)
  where I am the Training Theme Leader, overseeing the NCAS portfolio of short courses.  I
  work with the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA) community chemistry-aerosol
  model. This is used within the Met Office modelling infrastructure, and is a collaboration
  between the Universities of Cambridge, Leeds, Oxford, and the Met Office.  I am
  interested in chemistry-climate interactions and Earth-system modelling, and UKCA
  is a core component of the UK Earth System Model, UKESM. Recently I have been working
  to prepare UKCA for exascale computing systems, as well as improving our ability
  to compare models with observations, and developing emulators for various aspects
  of atmospheric chemistry.
