biography: 'Professor Colm-cille Caulfield holds a joint appointment in the Department
  of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and the Institute for Energy and
  Environmental Flows. The IEEF is a multi-disciplinary research centre devoted to
  fundamental studies of problems related to the energy industry and associated environmental
  impacts, defined in the broadest sense. It brings together industrialists and academics
  with expertise in applied mathematics, earth sciences, engineering and chemistry.


  Professor Caulfield is interested in working as part of such diverse teams to study
  various fluid flows in the environment, particularly in cases where density differences
  play a dynamical role. Of course, density differences, (due to temperature or composition
  variation) are ubiquitous in the environment. Understanding the fundamental properties
  of the associated fluid dynamics is key to ensuring sustainable human activity.
  To name just three important examples, understanding how density differences affect
  fluid flows can allow strategies to be developed to model the climate system, to
  deal with the dispersion of pollutants, or to minimise energy consumption within
  buildings.'
