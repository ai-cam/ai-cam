biography: "My expertise is in atomistic simulation, particularly in multi scale modelling
  that couples quantum mechanics to larger length scales. I am currently engaged in
  applying machine learning and other data intensive techniques to materials modelling
  problems, such as deriving force fields (interatomic potentials) from ab initio
  electronic structure data. Also interested in statistical problems in molecular
  dynamics, e.g. in enhanced sampling algorithms that can be used explore the global
  configuration space of materials and molecules. \n\nI help run the Lennard-Jones
  Centre, which has a seminar series where we often discuss the application of machine
  learning to physics, chemistry and materials science problems. "
