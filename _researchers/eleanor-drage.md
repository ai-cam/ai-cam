biography: "Eleanor is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge.
  She is CO-I on the Desirable Digitalisations project and PI on the Ammagamma
  project, an AI ethics and regulation project that helps companies respond to
  the EU AI act. She also uses feminist and anti-racist ideas to improve
  society’s understanding of AI, for example, to demonstrate why AI-powered
  hiring tools can’t de-bias hiring, and why AI can’t make neutral predictions
  about which protests are likely to turn violent. She is the co-host of The
  Good Robot Podcast, where she interviews top scholars and technologists about
  AI ethics, and is a TikToker for Carole Cadwalladr's All The Citizens' data
  rights channel. She’s the author of An Experience of the Impossible: The
  Planetary Humanism of European Women’s SF (Oct 2023), and co-editor of The
  Good Robot: Feminist Voices on the Future of Technology (Feb 2024), and
  Feminist AI: Critical Perspectives on Algorithms, Data and Intelligent
  Machines (Oct 2023). Eleanor is a Bye-Fellow and Tutor at Gonville & Caius
  College."
