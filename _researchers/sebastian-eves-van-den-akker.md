biography: 'Sebastian Eves-van den Akker is a geneticist with an interest in inter-kingdom
  communication. He investigates the genes that control a dialogue between kingdoms
  of life: the two-way molecular communication between plants and their parasites.
  The outcome of this communication dictates plant organ development, animal sex determination,
  and ultimately human food security.  Sebastian received his B. Sc. in Biology (2007-2010)
  from the University of Leeds, and his Ph. D. in Plant-Pathology (2010-2014) from
  the University of Leeds and the James Hutton Institute. In late 2014, Sebastian
  was awarded an Anniversary Future Leaders Fellowship from the Biotechnology and
  Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) to pursue independent research at the
  University of Dundee and the John Innes Centre (2015-2018). In 2018, he was awarded
  a BBSRC David Phillips Fellowship, a Research Fellowship at King’s College, and
  appointed Head of Group in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of
  Cambridge. In 2021 he was awarded a Crop Science Centre Fellowship at the University
  of Cambridge, and an Official Fellowship at King’s College Cambridge.'
