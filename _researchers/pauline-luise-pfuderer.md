biography: I'm a research student in Cancer Biology within the CRUK MRes + PhD
  Programme. Previously I did a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Molecular
  Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg (Germany), studying abroad at
  Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and researching cancer
  immunology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) in Boston. Ever since
  doing a lab rotation in single-cell RNA sequencing at EMBL-EBI/Cambridge
  Pharmacology, I am really interested in the computational side of biology.
  Since then, I focus on programming rather than pipetting and have been working
  on the computational side of cancer research since.
