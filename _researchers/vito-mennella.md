biography: r. Mennella received his B.Sc. cum laude from the University La Sapienza
  in Rome, Italy. After receiving a Fulbright Fellowship to continue his studies in
  the US, he obtained his MSc and PhD in Physiology and Biophysics at Albert Einstein
  College of Medicine in New York City, where he discovered the cellular mechanism
  of microtubule depolymerization mediated by Kinesin-13s and studied the mechanism
  of their regulation (Mennella et al, Nature Cell Biology, 2005; Science Editorsâ€™
  Choice, 2005; Journal of Cell Biology, 2008).  From there, Dr. Mennella joined the
  Howard Hughes Medical Institute laboratory of Dr. David Agard at the University
  of California San Francisco as a postdoctoral fellow, where he pioneered application
  of super-resolution microscopy and advanced imaging methods in organelle cell biology,
  in particular for analysing centrosome and cilia function. At UCSF, Dr. Mennella
  was first to describe the architecture of the Pericentriolar Material of centrosomes,
  debunking a long-standing assumption of its solely amorphous nature (Mennella et
  al, Nature Cell Biology, 2012; Nature Cell Biology News and Views 2012; Nature Reviews
  Molecular and Cell Biology Highlights 2012; Trends in Cell Biology, 2014, 2015)  In
  2014, Dr. Mennella became an Assistant Professor in the Biochemistry Department
  at University of Toronto, where he applied advanced imaging methods for translational
  medicine research increasing sensitivity of diagnosis of rare lung disease motile
  ciliopathy Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and for characterizing novel cellular
  organelles structures (Sydor et al. Elife, 2018, Liu et al, Science Translational
  Medicine, 2020, Featured on magazine cover).  In 2019, Dr. Mennella became Associate
  Professor in the National Research Health Center and Biomedical Research center
  at U. of Southampton where he published the discovery of a novel type of cilium
  in the airways (Nguyen et al. Developmental Cell, 2020 and Liu et al. Developmental
  Cell, 2020) and led a collaborative team to discover a new isoform of ACE-2, the
  receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in airway epithelial cells published in Nature Medicine.  In
  2021, Dr. Mennella became Director of Research at the MRC Toxicology Unit where
  he studies the effect of exposure to environmental pollutants and drugs on the airways
  using advanced imaging technologies and AI image models. Dr. Mennella has received
  external funding from UKRI-BBSRC, Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR),
  National Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada and new investigator awards
  from CIHR Institute of Human Development and Child Health, the ATS-PCD foundation,
  AAIR and other charities.
