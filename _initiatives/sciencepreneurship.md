    European Leadership in Innovation with AI and Science (ELIAS) is a
    cross-European network of AI incubators. The Cambridge ELIAS Node will
    bridge between Cambridge's world-class innovation ecosystem and the
    frontiers of AI, driving innovation in AI that serves science, citizens, and
    society.

    Working collaboratively across the Cambridge ecosystem, the node will 

    - Convene networks across the academic, start-up, and VC communities;

    - Create training and mentorship opportunities for scientists interested in entrepreneurship;

    - Connect sciencepreneurs to technical support and infrastructure to enable innovation at the frontiers of AI.
