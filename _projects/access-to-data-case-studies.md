#### Access to data for research: lessons for the National Data Library from the front lines of AI innovation.

![](/assets/uploads/data-library.jpg)

Access to data is a vital enabler of AI innovation. Inspired by current discussions about the UK’s AI policy landscape – and the opportunities presented by initiatives such as the National Data Library – this report presents a series of case studies exploring the value that access to data for research can create, and the barriers researchers face in accessing such data.

These case studies also show the need for a digital infrastructure that connects data, researchers, and resources that enable data use. The report calls for the National Data Library to take action to:

* Co-design its functions and structures with user communities in research, business, and civil society.
* Convene the UK's research capabilities to drive progress tackling critical challenges.
* Connect into communities of practice to ensure its work is having beneficial real-world impact.
