#### Access to data for research: lessons for the National Data Library from the front lines of AI innovation.

![](/assets/uploads/data-library.jpg)

In this joint report from ai@cam, [Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy](https://www.mctd.ac.uk/) and the [Bennett Institute for Public Policy](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/), we present a series of case studies on access to data for research. These case studies illustrate the barriers that researchers are grappling with, and suggest how a new wave of policy development could help address these.



Each show innovative uses of data for research in areas that are critically important to science and society, including:

* Diagnosing the data challenges in cancer research  - [Dr Mireia Crispin](https://www.oncology.cam.ac.uk/research/our-research/crispin)
* A sea change in social media research - [Dr Amy Orben](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/amy.orben/)
* Conserving with code: How data is helping to save our planet - [Dr Sadiq Jaffer](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/sj514) and [Dr Alec Christie](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/alec-christie)
* Breaking the ice: Addressing data barriers in Polar research - [Dr Scott Hosking ](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/jask/)
* Making a difference with data: Insights from COVID-19 - [Professor Stefan Scholtes](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/people/stefan-scholtes/)
* Untangling the web of supply chain data - [Professor Vasco Carvalho](https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/faculty/vmpmdc2)

The projects highlight crucial design considerations for the UK’s National Data Library and the need for a digital infrastructure that connects data, researchers, and resources that enable data use. By centring the experiences of researchers on the front-line of AI innovation, this report hopes to bring some of those barriers into focus and inform continued conversations in this area.
