title: "Revolutionising women’s health, female fertility and early infant
  neurodevelopment using AI "
excerpt: This project aims to develop cheaper, less invasive and more accurate
  AI-assisted tests that can be used throughout the conception to childhood
  journey. These tests will be used to enhance and personalise fertility
  outcomes, and support the transition to parenting. This research will play a
  key part in improving fertility and women's health outcomes and shed light on
  the still largely unknown cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms governing
  the development of life.

**From conception to childhood: Revolutionising women’s health, female fertility and early infant neurodevelopment using AI**

The UK has the largest gender health gap in the G20 and declining fertility rates, with women's health issues not well understood.

This project aims to develop cheaper, less invasive and more accurate AI-assisted tests that can be used throughout the conception to childhood journey. These tests will be used to enhance and personalise fertility outcomes, and support the transition to parenting. This research will play a key part in improving fertility and women's health outcomes and shed light on the still largely unknown cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms governing the development of life.

The University of Cambridge’s Departments of Psychology, Computer Science, and Physics among others will lead this project, in partnership with two leading specialty hospitals.

Dr Staci Weiss, AI-deas challenge co-lead said: “AI-deas provides an interdisciplinary platform bringing together data and new AI analytic approaches to accelerate identification of reproductive health biomarkers from embryo through to neonate."

Mo Vali, AI-deas challenge co-lead said: "We will seek to revolutionise reproductive health technology using state-of-the-art AI methods, leveraging Cambridge's long tradition of research in this field. Translating our research from lab to clinic by developing rigorous tests to improve clinical outcomes will benefit the wider public and help to ease the NHS burden.”
